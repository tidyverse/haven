  desc: >
    SAS, SPSS, and Stata share a simply concept of "labelled" vectors, which
    are similar to factors but a little more general. The `labelled()` class
    provides a natural representaion in R.

- title: tagged_na
  desc: >
    Both SAS and Stata supported tagged missing values, where a missing value
    can have multiple "types", given by an letter from A through Z.
    `tagged_na()` provides a convenient way of representing these types of
    missing values in R by taking advantage of the binary representation of
    `NA`.

  desc: >
     There are a number of SPSS/SAS/Stata features that have no direct
     equivalent in R. Haven preserves them so you can choose what do with
     them. To simply eliminate them, use one of the zap functions.
