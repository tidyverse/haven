\title{Labelled vectors for SPSS}
\usage{
labelled_spss(x, labels, na_values = NULL, na_range = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector to label. Must be either numeric (integer or double) or
character.}

\item{labels}{A named vector. The vector should be the same type as
\code{x}. Unlike factors, labels don't need to be exhaustive: only a fraction
of the values might be labelled.}

\item{na_values}{A vector of values that should also be considered as missing.}

\item{na_range}{A numeric vector of length two giving the (inclusive) extents
of the range. Use \code{-Inf} and \code{Inf} if you want the range to be
open ended.}
}
\description{
This class is only used when \code{user_na = TRUE} in
\code{\link{read_sav}()}. It is similar to the \code{\link{labelled}} class
but it also models SPSS's user-defined missings, which can be up to
three distinct values, or for numeric vectors a range.
}
\examples{
x1 <- labelled_spss(1:10, c(Good = 1, Bad = 8), na_values = c(9, 10))
is.na(x1)

x2 <- labelled_spss(1:10, c(Good = 1, Bad = 8), na_range = c(9, Inf))
is.na(x2)
