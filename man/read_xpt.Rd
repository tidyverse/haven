\title{Read and write SAS transport files}
\usage{
read_xpt(file)

write_xpt(data, path, version = 8, name = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Either a path to a file, a connection, or literal data
(either a single string or a raw vector).

Files ending in \code{.gz}, \code{.bz2}, \code{.xz}, or \code{.zip} will
be automatically uncompressed. Files starting with \code{http://},
\code{https://}, \code{ftp://}, or \code{ftps://} will be automatically
downloaded. Remote gz files can also be automatically downloaded and
decompressed.

Literal data is most useful for examples and tests. It must contain at
least one new line to be recognised as data (instead of a path).}

\item{data}{Data frame to write.}

\item{path}{Path to a file where the data will be written.}

\item{version}{Version of transport file specification to use: either 5 or 8.}

\item{name}{Member name to record in file. Defaults to file name sans
extension. Must be <= 8 characters for version 5, and <= 32 characters
for version 8.}
}
\value{
A tibble, data frame variant with nice defaults.

  Variable labels are stored in the "label" attribute of each variable.
  It is not printed on the console, but the RStudio viewer will show it.

  `write_xpt()` returns the input `data` invisibly.
}
\description{
The SAS transport format is a open format, as is required for submission
of the data to the FDA.
}
\details{
Currently haven can read and write logical, integer, numeric, character
and factors. See \code{\link{labelled_spss}} for how labelled variables in
SPSS are handled in R. \code{read_spss} is an alias for \code{read_sav}.
}
\examples{
tmp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xpt")
write_xpt(mtcars, tmp)
read_xpt(tmp)
}
