\title{Signal a pseudo-missing value}
\usage{
bare_na(x)

\arguments{
\item{x}{The replacement value.}
}
\description{
\code{bare_na()} signals to the subset-assignment operator that a value
}
\details{
R works with system-missing values represented by the \code{NA}
object. However, other statistical softwares allow ordinary values
to be flagged as missing. These pseudo-missing values may or may
not have labels attached. When they don't have labels attached, use
\code{bare_na()} to signal missingness to replacement operators.

\examples{
# Let's create a vector that has two labelled pseudo-na values ("X"
# and "N/A"), and one non-labelled pseudo-na value (the first value)
v <- labelled(
  c("Z", "M", "M", "F", "X", "N/A"),
  labels = c(Male = "M", Female = "F", Refused = "X", "Not applicable" = "N/A"),
  label_na = c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE),
  x_na = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
)
is_pseudo_na(v)

# If we change the first value to an ordinary value, it looses its
# missing status:
v[1] <- "F"
is_pseudo_na(v)

# Changing a value to a labelled pseudo-missing works automatically:
v[2] <- "N/A"
is_pseudo_na(v)

# To signal a non-labelled pseudo-missing, use bare_na():
v[3] <- bare_na("X")
is_pseudo_na(v)
