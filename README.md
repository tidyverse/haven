## Overview

Haven enables R to read and write various data formats used by other
statistical packages by wrapping the fantastic
[ReadStat](https://github.com/WizardMac/ReadStat) C library written by
[Evan Miller](https://www.evanmiller.org). Haven is part of the
[tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). Currently it supports:

- **SAS**: `read_sas()` reads `.sas7bdat` + `.sas7bcat` files and
  `read_xpt()` reads SAS transport files (versions 5 and 8).
  `write_xpt()` writes SAS transport files (versions 5 and 8).

- **SPSS**: `read_sav()` reads `.sav` files and `read_por()` reads the
  older `.por` files. `write_sav()` writes `.sav` files.

- **Stata**: `read_dta()` reads `.dta` files (up to version 15).
  `write_dta()` writes `.dta` files (versions 8-15).

The output objects:

- Are [tibbles](https://github.com/tidyverse/tibble), which have a
  better print method for very long and very wide files.

- Translate value labels into a new `labelled()` class, which preserves
  the original semantics and can easily be coerced to factors with
  `as_factor()`. Special missing values are preserved. See
  `vignette("semantics")` for more details.

- Dates and times are converted to R date/time classes. Character
  vectors are not converted to factors.

## Installation

``` r
# The easiest way to get haven is to install the whole tidyverse:
install.packages("tidyverse")

# Alternatively, install just haven:
install.packages("haven")
```

## Usage

``` r
library(haven)

# SAS
read_sas("mtcars.sas7bdat")
write_sas(mtcars, "mtcars.sas7bdat")

# SPSS
read_sav("mtcars.sav")
write_sav(mtcars, "mtcars.sav")

# Stata
read_dta("mtcars.dta")
write_dta(mtcars, "mtcars.dta")
```
